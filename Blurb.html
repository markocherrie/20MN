This is a tool for people living in Scotland to give you more information about your neighbourhood (within a 20 minute walking distance from you). 
Maybe you have just moved into the area... or maybe you've always lived there but don't know everything that is available. 
You can compare how your neighbourhood compares to Scotland as a whole. 
Once you have an idea of the kinds of amenities around you, you might feel more equipped to answer questions on
how well they serve you and fill out a Place Standard assessment - https://www.placestandard.scot/"
